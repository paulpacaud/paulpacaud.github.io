Hi, I’m Paul! I’m a PhD student passionate about blending Computer Vision, NLP, and Robotics. I graduated from <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr">CentraleSupélec</a>, and spent some time at <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>. My long-term aspiration aims to push the boundaries of AI’s ability to perceive, understand, and act in the physical world.

I’ve had the rare opportunity to work in very diverse environments ranging from applied science in industry (quant trading @ Engie), product development in startup (startup @ Brio) and academic research (PhD studies @ Inria). Here are a few takeaways:

At <a href="https://brio.ink/">Brio</a>, the startup I co-founded, I built and deployed AI-driven HR tools, ranging from interview prep for students to HR search engines for recruiters. Our interview prep platform was adopted by 21 universities in France and used by >12,000 students. Brio is now backed by Techstars San Francisco. I am glad to have bootstrapped such a project that helped so many students.

At <a href="https://gems.engie.com/">Engie Trading</a>, I helped to approximate hard constrained optimization problems on the Power Market, and I also deployed applied ML models on the Gas Market.

At <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/">Inria and École Normale Supérieure Paris</a>, I’m super excited to be at the cutting edge of Robotics/3D/Language. I mostly work on VLMs for Robotic Manipulation.

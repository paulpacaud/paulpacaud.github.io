I am Paul, a passionate master's student and entrepreneur in AI, particularly focusing on Large Language Models. 

I have two years of versatile professional experience where computer science theory meets practice across multiple environments. I worked as a Visiting Student Researcher at the Stanford AI Lab, delving into AI and Haptics Robotics applications. I engaged in Cloud infrastructure consulting at PwC, helping businesses move from rigid, legacy platforms to highly scalable, and resilient cloud architectures. Since September 2023, I have been working for Engie in Operations Research for Quantitative Trading in the power market. In parallel, I co-founded a start-up in EdTech called TalimAI where I have been developing a web application that leverages LLMs as coaching assistants preparing students for their job interviews. (We're hiring!)

Essentially, my research interest is focused on utilizing Large Language Models for meaningful applications and developing more efficient and resilient foundational language models.

I am Paul, a passionate master's student and entrepreneur in AI, particularly focusing on Large Language Models. 

I have two years of versatile professional experience where computer science theory meets practice across multiple environments: research, consulting, entrepreneurship, and quantitative trading. I worked as a Visiting Student Researcher at the <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford AI Lab</a>, delving into AI and Haptics Robotics applications. I engaged in Cloud infrastructure consulting at <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/consulting/cloud-transformation.html">PwC</a>, helping businesses move from rigid, legacy platforms to highly scalable, and resilient cloud architectures. Since September 2023, I have been working for <a href="https://www.engie.com/en">Engie</a> in Operations Research within the desk of Quantitative Power Trading. In parallel, I co-founded a start-up in EdTech called <a href="https://talimai.com/landing-page">TalimAI</a> where I have been developing a web application that leverages LLMs as coaching assistants preparing students for their job interviews. (We're hiring!)

Essentially, my research interest is focused on utilizing Large Language Models for meaningful applications and developing more efficient and resilient foundational language models.

## My role

At Brio, I am responsible for creating what we called Brio Intelligence, which was our multi-agent framework that empowered every parts of our app across:

- Our AutoGrader: How do you task a general-purpose LLM to assess objectively a candidate’s performance and generates a thorough grading report ?
- Our agentic Interview Simulation: How do you give some sense of System 2 Slow-thinking ability to the System 1 Interviewer that discuss in real-time with the candidate ? Like when should it followup, how does it keep track of the interview flow, which question to ask, and so on? And this without the candidate to wait for the answer?
- Our Information Retrieval stack: Students use our app to prepare for very hard interviews like JPMorgan’s finance interviews, how do we make sure to ask the most likely questions ? this involved large scale web scraping, and a smart retrieval process out of our database.

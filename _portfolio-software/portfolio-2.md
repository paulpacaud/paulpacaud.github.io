## Introduction
Over two years of work, we build a web-based Enterprise Resource Planning to help CentraleSup√©lec's student-led consulting firm manage their day-to-day operations. The level of efficiency, robustness and customization had never been surpassed by any other student-led consulting firm in France.

## Features
The application is both for front and support functions. It allows consultants to manage their missions while giving dashboards to support teams to manage the firm.

Consultants can manage their missions from A to Z. They can generate legal contracts for the clients (such as confidentiality agreements and mission contracts), hire students by pushing email campaigns to the campus, follow the progress of the mission, and upload deliverables.

Here's a peek at the technical aspects that make Athena work so well:

#### Front End

The front end of Athena is crafted using Angular, employing a mix of TypeScript, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive and intuitive interface. For UI/UX design, our team utilizes Figma to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

#### Back End

For the back end, Athena operates on a Node.js server framework, specifically Express.js. This setup allows for a robust and scalable application infrastructure.

Data management is handled by a SQL relational database.

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment

Our development cycle is streamlined with GitHub CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that code updates are automatically and reliably deployed to production with minimal downtime. Every Pull Request is peer-reviewed.

#### On-Premise Infrastructure

For on-premise solutions, Athena relies on Synology's robust and versatile storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and security. This Network Attached Storage (NAS) is kept on-premise and stores our backups.

#### Cloud Services

Athena leverages cloud services like Power BI to handle analytics and data visualization, providing insightful metrics and driving data-driven decisions.

Hosting is efficiently managed through OVH cloud.
